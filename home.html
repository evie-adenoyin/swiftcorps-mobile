                                   Stores like Staples and Best Buy carry routers, switches
                                    and wireless access points that are better used in home
                                     applications and lack the throughput and reliability 
                                     needed by a business. SWIFT-CORPS will use the

                            <h4>Remote Support</h4>
                            <p>Many issues such as not being able to print, 
                                password resets, and email not working can often
                                 be fixed quickly by a technician logging in remotely 
                                 to your workstation or server without the need to have a 
                                 technician to come out to your place of business. 
                                 This accomplishes two things: First, the issue gets 
                                 fixed much quicker because there is no waiting for a
                                  IT support technician to make it out on site. Second,
                                   it saves money because you are not paying for a full 
                                   on-site IT support trip. We recommend using remote IT 
                                   support whenever possible, and allowing us to setup remote
                                    access on each workstation and server. This will enable us 
                                    to deliver the most cost-efficient and quickest IT support experience possible.</p>

                        <h4>Data & Network Security</h4>
                        <p> It is important to have a strong plan in place
                             to protect your client’s data and your firm’s
                              information from the outside world. Complex password 
                              requirements and good antivirus software is just the 
                              tip of the iceberg. Business class routers and firewalls  
                              with advanced protection technologies, secure VPN, certificate 
                              based encryption, Bitlocker drive encryption and more should all be considered.</p>

                            <p> Have you ever gone months or even more than
                                 a year between needing a client’s particular 
                                 financial records, only to find that it is missing
                                  or corrupted after all that time? Archiving copies
                                   of your backups solves this issue. With archiving we 
                                   can go back and pull a copy of the data from when you
                                    worked on it last. With our archiving system, missing
                                     or corrupt tax returns or financial documents become
                                      an issue of the past.</p>

            <h3>Our Accounting & Financial Industry Overview</h3>
        <div class="last-section-note">
            <p>Finance & Accountant IT Support is a critical 
                component of financial industries today. CPA firms, 
                accountants and other financial firms have some unique
                 challenges for IT support. Furthermore, CPA’s, accountants, and other
                   finance professionals have never been more personally at risk for maintaining
                    appropriate security and accuracy of client financial<br> documents and records.
                     The penalties for failing to comply with government regulation in the financial 
                     industry can be devastating. At SWIFT-CORPS we have been in the front<br> lines of IT
                      support in the accountant and financial industry as these changes have occurred.

                      and finance world. We can successfully plan, setup and maintain a first-rate technology
